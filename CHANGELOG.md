# Changelog

All notable changes to Portunus are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.5.1]

### Changed
- Proxy Envoy cluster for the Portunus upstream now uses `STRICT_DNS`
  with `dns_refresh_rate: 5s`. Required for Service Connect on the
  proxy → Portunus path: Cloud Map returns a multivalue A-record per
  service, and `LOGICAL_DNS` would pin to whichever IP resolved first
  for the cluster's lifetime, funnelling all traffic from one proxy
  task into a single Portunus task. `STRICT_DNS` load-balances across
  every healthy task; the 5 s refresh brings new tasks into rotation
  within seconds of an autoscale or rolling deploy.

## [0.5.0]

### Added
- `POST /cache/flush` endpoint that invalidates all cached auth responses
  via Redis `FLUSHDB`, for use when an API key is suspected compromised.
- Opt-in CORS support via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Supports exact origins
  and wildcard suffix matching (e.g. `*.example.com`). Implemented in the
  Envoy Lua filter — handles OPTIONS preflight directly and adds
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to proxied and error responses. When
  unset, behaviour is unchanged.

### Fixed
- Switch CI to `localstack/localstack:community-archive`; the default
  image now requires an auth token.

## [0.4.0]

### Changed
- WebSocket routing uses `Upgrade: websocket` header matching instead of
  `/ws/` path prefix. Clients can now upgrade on any path (e.g.,
  `/v1/responses`) without a special prefix.

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- WebSocket relay endpoint (`/ws/*`) with auth and per-message Kinesis logging.
- `ws-echo` echo server for load testing.

### Changed
- Lua filter now logs async errors instead of swallowing them.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- `MetadataRecord.secret_arn` — Portunus now publishes the full AWS Secrets
  Manager ARN of the API key secret to Kinesis metadata records.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Release workflow: triggers on tag push (`v*`), creates GitHub release with
  auto-generated notes.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with release process documentation.
- Version derived from git tags via `hatch-vcs` (no hardcoded version in
  `pyproject.toml`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Initial release of Portunus API key proxy.
- Envoy proxy with Lua filters for transparent credential swapping.
- FastAPI backend for authentication and API key retrieval from AWS Secrets
  Manager.
- Redis caching for API keys and STS credential validation.
- Kinesis logging for all proxied traffic (metadata, request/response
  headers and bodies).
- Pluggable backends (`AwsAuthBackend`, `DebugPublisher`) for secrets and
  log publishing.
- Full unit and integration test suite.
- ARN parsing utilities for principal identity extraction.
